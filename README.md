## Description

My motivation for making this project was to make an application using inquiry that can easily search and pull up information from a MySQL database.
Since most of the world has transitioned to logging data and storing data online, I believe it is very important to understand how data is stored and retrieved using simple and complex applications.
Now that I built this application, I have a much better understanding of how MySQL is used in many applications and websites as a way to efficiently hold and store large amounts of data!
